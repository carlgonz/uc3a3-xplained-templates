So. Somewhere there's defined SDRAM_PART_HEADER, and sdramc.h tries to include
that file.

Initially, I undefined that value from the uc3 board (since it's WRONG and
uses the 16M16 instead of the 4M16...). That works until you try to compile
sdramc.c, which doesn't allow us to undefine the part header.

The only thing I could figure out was to use USER_BOARD, so there you have it.
